# Version Control Systems

## What is a version control system?

Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code.

They have `repositories` which contain all the edits and historical versions of a project

`Checkouts` are personal copies of all the files in a project. Editing these won't affect the code in a repository unless it is `commit`ted and `push`ed

To make your changes visible to others, 4 things are required:

- You commit
- You push
- They pull
- They update

## Why to use a version control system?

- multiple people can work simultaneously on a single project
- gives people the possibility to use multiple computers to to work on a project
- integrates the work that is done by different members of the team
- provides access to the historical versions of a project (insurance against computer crashes and data loss)
