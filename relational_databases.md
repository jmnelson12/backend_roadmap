# Relational Databases

Going to focus on **PostgreSQL** because it is what I use at work, and I want a deeper understanding of it.

## What is PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that store and scale data workloads.

- Runs on all major operating systems
- [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)-compliant

## Why use PostgreSQL

- you can define your own data types
- build out custom functions
- write code from different programming languages without recompiling your database
- highly extensible
- It is an excellent DBMS, which is scalable, performs well, allows replication, supports ACID and a big subset of the SQL standard (in several cases, it is a superset).
- Is much better at data types than the other DBMSs, with a more rich semantics, with geo-spatial types, complex numbers, etc.
- It supports several methods of indexation, including B-trees, Genetic Algorithms based indexes, and GIN indexes that accelerates full-text searches.

## TODO

get a vm set up and go through the tutorial
