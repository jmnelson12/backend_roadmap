Install Video for Ubuntu [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_C1B8fDvg)

Will go through the [Getting Started](https://golang.org/doc/#getting-started) sections here. Will create other projects outside of this for more learning

## Tutorial: Getting Started

Take a look [here](./learn_a_language/getting_started.go)

## Tutorial: Create a module
